## Make your own online journal

You can keep your own online journal with this template and GitHub Pages.

### Journal entries
Write your journal entries in the ```journal.txt``` file. A journal entry is enclosed in square brackets (```[``` and ```]```).
Any text preceding a pipe character (```|```) will be treated as a timestamp. Any text after is considered the actual text of the journal entry.
Any text in the journal file that is not enclosed in square brackets will be ignored.

### The index page
The ```index.html``` page automatically displays all of your journal entries.
It lists the entries in the order of their appearance in the ```journal.txt``` file, so you will have to write new entries at the top of the journal file if you want the entries to appear in chronological order.

### GitHub Pages
You can use [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages) to post your journal online.
